WPS Backup provides robust protection for all your WordPress sites, with single file and folder recovery, as well as bare-site recovery.

== Description ==

WPS Backup is the ultimate in backup protection for your WordPress site.

All data and metadata is encrypted before it leaves your server, and is stored securely using military-grade 256-bit AES encryption.

Our exclusive [Bare-Site Recovery](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gUtPZ61xzHc&feature=emb_logo "WPSBackup Bare-Site Recovery Demo Video") feature is the quickest and easiest way to recover your site from a disaster. Upload the recovery file, enter your license and encryption details, and select the desired recovery point.

The WPS Backup plugin communicates directly from your server to the backup servers in our secure datacenters, using 256-bit AES encryption. The encryption key to unlock your data resides on your server, and we do not have the ability to decrypt your data.
